It was then that I found water polo, a unique mix of endurance, skill, and teamwork. I was instantly hooked, begging my mom to play on the local club team. This was over 10 years ago, since then I have played for my local high school, community college, and now the UCSB club team.\n\n\nTraveling\nFortunately, I have been able to travel to many incredible places, taking in their landscapes and learning about their unique cultures. My personal favorite locations have been Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Hawaii. I hope to keep exploring in the near future and learn more about environmental opportunities in unfamiliar places.\n\n\nSurfing\nGrowing up near the ocean, I remember always loving the beach and going in the water. This naturally progressed into learning to surf, my personal favorite way to connect with nature. I not only love the aspect of reading the waves and expressing myself through my surfing, but I love to just sit out in the water and take in each beautiful day. I am also very interested in surfboard shaping and design, hopefully making my first in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentura college water polo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonteacuto delle Alpi, Italy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentura point"
