A short list of what I love to do.

## Water Polo

From a young age, I tried many different sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis, but didn't find a meaningful connection with any of them. It was then that I found water polo, a unique mix of endurance, skill, and teamwork.Â I was instantly hooked, begging my mom to play on the local club team. This was over 10 years ago, since then I have played for my local high school, community college, and now UCSB on the club team.

## Surfing 

It was through my water polo teammates that I found surfing.

## Rock Climbing
